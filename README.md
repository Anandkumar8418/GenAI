# GenAI: Phase 1 & Phase 2 ðŸš€

This repository contains resources, notebooks, and assignments for the **Generative AI Learning Track**.  
It covers both **Transformers & GPT-based models (Phase 1)** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (Phase 2)**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: Transformers & GPT
**Objective:**  
Learn the foundations of **transformers**, build a basic model from scratch, and fine-tune **GPT-2** for creative text generation.

**Key Components:**
- Dataset creation, cleaning, and tokenization  
- Understanding self-attention, positional encoding, and encoderâ€“decoder structure  
- Implementing a simple transformer model for text completion  
- Fine-tuning GPT-2 on a custom creative dataset  
- Model evaluation (loss metrics, BLEU, qualitative checks)  
- Deployment of fine-tuned models on Hugging Face  

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned and tokenized dataset  
- Transformer model implementation with explanation  
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 model

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: GANs
**Objective:**  
Understand and implement **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and their variants.

**Key Components:**
- Basics of Generator & Discriminator, BCE loss, and training process  
- Implementing and comparing FCGAN & DCGAN  
- Exploring Wasserstein GANs (wGANs) for stable training  
- Implementing Conditional GANs (cGANs) for controlled outputs  

**Deliverables:**
- GAN implementations (Vanilla, DCGAN, wGAN, cGAN)  
- Assignments & notebooks documenting experiments

## ðŸŽ¯ Assessment Criteria
- **Dataset Quality & Preparation**  
- **Theoretical Understanding** (transformers & GANs concepts)  
- **Model Implementation & Fine-Tuning**  
- **Quality of Generated Outputs**  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Expected Outcomes
- Hands-on understanding of **transformers, GPT, and GANs**  
- Ability to fine-tune and deploy generative models  
- Confidence in reading research papers and building your own generative AI systems
